How to set this shit up for testing purposes.

1. Get XAMPP.
2. Install Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP Control Panel.
3. Get ``database moment.db`` from https://github.com/smplybored/framebit-2005
4. Make a database called ``poktube``
5. Import ``database moment.db`` to the ``poktube`` database
6. Make a folder called ``preload`` in the content folder if it does not exist.

## To do
* Improve the All users page. (only some shitty internal incomplete admin control panel exists)
* Add original July 2005 CSS as an option (along with June 2005 CSS)
