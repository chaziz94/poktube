How to set this shit up for testing purposes.

1. Get XAMPP.
2. Install Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP Control Panel.
3. Ask Chaziz for the PokTube MySQL databases (users, videos).
4. Import those databases with PHPmyAdmin.

## Notes
This is not a 2005 YouTube clone, as of writing this, I am planning of changing the user interface into something else. The 2017 BitView Wayback Machine copies were used because they were simple to edit, compared to the spaghetti code that is 2006+.

I do plan of keeping the 2017 BV UI as an option (along with possibly the original early-July 2005 UI, and a lighter June 2005 UI as well), but the default will be something else.

## To do
* Improve the All videos and All users page.
* Implement thumbnails (they currently use the uploader's profile picture).
* Actually make the Featured Videos and Recommended List work (multiple arrays afaik).
* Find a better name.
* Make a proper logo (originally it was some YouTube-styled logo, but when I revived this project, I replaced it with a placeholder)

I got permission from Sniped, so I guess we can use parts of the source code.
