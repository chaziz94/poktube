How to set this shit up for testing and development purposes.

1. Get XAMPP.
2. Install Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP Control Panel.
3. Get ``poktube.sql`` from here
4. Make a database called ``poktube``
5. Import ``poktube.sql`` to the ``poktube`` database
6. Make a folder called ``preload`` in the content folder if it does not exist.

## To do
* Improve the All users page. (only some shitty internal incomplete admin control panel exists)
* Add categories
* Add ActiveX player as an option (shitty bad idea but then i don't want to bother patching flash player)
